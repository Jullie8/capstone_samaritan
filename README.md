##  What we've learned

Building this project in a small amount of time as part of a coding project was a challenge. 

A bigger challenge was builing a chrome extension for the first time and as a team connect all the pieces together to transform it into a functional application. 

Most of the technologies used were new to us and required research and reading to figure out how to best use and implement it in our code. 

Implementing these concepts was also new and we learned that chrome extensions had different ways to debug files. For instance the pop up has a pop up console, content scripts can be debugged through the regular console and background scripts also have their own console.

## Future Implementations

* Refine category matching (Eg. location, preferred charities)
* Introduce a simplified payment method 
* Offer other calls for action: volunteer, vote, contact representatives etc.
